# corresnet
Corresnet is a deep-learning-based image jitter correction method for synchrotron nano-resolution tomographic reconstruction.


## Abstract

Nano-resolution full-field transmission X-ray microscopy has been successfully applied to a wide range of research fields thanks to its capability of non-destructively reconstructing the 3D structures with high resolution. Due to constraints in the practical implementation, such as imperfections in the hardware , the nano-tomography data is often associated with random image jitter. Without a proper image registration process prior to reconstruction, the quality of the resulting reconstructions will be compromised. Here we present a deep-learning-based image jitter correction method which registers the projection images with high efficiency and accuracy, facilitating a high-quality tomographic reconstruction. We demonstrate and validate our development using synthetic and experimental datasets. Our method is effective and readily applicable to a broad range of applications.
